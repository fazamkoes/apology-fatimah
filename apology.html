		<h2>I'm sorry.</h2>
		<p>The things I wish to tell you are far too long so beneath this is a link to a place where you could read it all. I love you, btw.</p>

		<p>The image is the link, sorry. muah</p>

		<!-- Reasons -->
		<h2>Reasons why I love you.</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>You remind and warn me in a very calm tone when I do or say things I shouldn't. Not once have you ever raised your voice at me even when I've done something wrong.</li>
			<li>Not once did you fail in making me stop my overthinking by reassuring me with your words. You're constantly checking up on me and asking if I'm alright.</li>
			<li>To learn and to grow. You make me a better person with all the things you advise me to do or to say. You teach me all the right and correct mannerisms that are respectful and that nobody has ever told me I was wrong.</li>
			<li>You make me want to be patient. As a person, I'm constantly in a rush and want things to be speedy. You make me think otherwise. You make it okay for me to wait a while.</li>
			<li>The way you get so excited over the smallest things like me giving my perfume to you makes me feel so appreciated and that what I'm doing is not taken for granted.</li>
			<li>You're always there for me. Always present even when I'm at my worst.</li>
		</ol>

		<!-- Things to do -->
		<h2>Things we should do.</h2>
		<p>Now look, I know I just lost a huge amount of money but that doesn't stop me from trying to give you the world. Not everything has to be in the form of gold, right? So whenever you're ready, I've listed down a couple things I wish to do with you that would cost the both of us little to no money. I look forward to doing them with you in the future baby.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Watch movies. Cmbyn if that's what you want.</li>
			<li>Picnic at the park. I can cook for you, you can cook for me.</li>
			<li>Kayaking at the Putrajaya Lake Club.</li>
			<li>Head to a bookstore, I choose a book for you, you choose a book for me, head out to a park, read each other's choice of books.</li>
			<li>I'm not good at art but we could buy one of those paint by numbers sets.</li>
			<li>Stargazing.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You don't like talking that much and I don't know how to start conversations so going for a date with just your presence right by my side is far more than enough for me. I love you so much sayang. I'm sorry again for all that I've said.</p>


		<!-- Open When -->
		<h2>Open When:</h2>
		<p>I know you're one who finds it difficult to open up to me so whenever you're feeling some type of way, clink on any of these that suits your feelings best. Heads up, baby. I know you can do it.</p>
